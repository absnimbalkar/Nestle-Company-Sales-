### Project Title: **Nestlé Company Sales Overview Analysis Using Excel**

### Project Description:

This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Nestlé's sales performance over a specified period by using Microsoft Excel as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization. The objective is to examine sales trends, identify growth areas, and highlight any potential challenges in Nestlé's product portfolio, market regions, and customer segments.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Data Collection & Preparation:**
   - Collect historical sales data from Nestlé's sales reports, financial statements, or other relevant sources.
   - Organize and clean the data in Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis.
   - Categorize sales data by key variables, such as product categories, geographic regions, customer segments, and time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - **Trend Analysis:** Use Excel's built-in functions (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF) to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total sales, growth rate, and market share.
   - **Segmentation Analysis:** Analyze sales by product category, region, or customer type to identify areas of strength or potential growth opportunities.
   - **Profitability Metrics:** Calculate gross margin, profit per unit, and other profitability metrics based on available data.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create dynamic charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to visually represent key sales metrics and trends over time.
   - Use PivotTables and PivotCharts for deeper insights into specific dimensions of the sales data (e.g., sales by region or product category).
   - Develop dashboards for quick, interactive analysis, enabling decision-makers to easily interpret sales performance.

4. **Forecasting & Insights:**
   - Use Excel’s forecasting tools (e.g., FORECAST, TREND functions) to project future sales based on historical trends.
   - Identify patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and anomalies to forecast upcoming sales performance and make recommendations for optimization.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Compile the results of the analysis into a professional, easy-to-understand report that summarizes key findings, insights, and recommendations.
   - Provide actionable insights for decision-makers within Nestlé to help guide future sales strategies and business decisions.

### Deliverables:

- Excel workbooks with organized and cleaned sales data.
- Interactive dashboards and visualizations highlighting key sales trends and KPIs.
- A final report summarizing the sales performance, including recommendations for improvement or strategic focus.
